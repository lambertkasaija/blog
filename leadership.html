    <h3>Leadership week1</h3>
    <p>I was not sure how or what the  leadership course was about, but was all energetic and excited about the whole start of  this training. Julia was interesting, I realised the  course unit was going to be two weeks and more interactive, was also happy there not going to be any examinations and it was our own push that was going to determine how we succeed in the course.</p>
    <P><strong>Key take aways</strong></P>
        <ul>
            <li>Realised we are a product of our choices and not our circumstances </li>
            <li>I am free to chose and ultimately responsible for my happiness</li>
            <li>Its not what they do to us, but how we respond to what they do to us</li>
            <li>Use proactive language, it is a language of leadership</li>
            <li>Begin everything with the end in mind </li>
            <li>Develop a personal mission statement of what I want to achieve </li>
            <li>Write down how you want to be remembered and then what you need to do to be remembered that way</li>
            <li>Have an object in mind that  represents my essence </li>
            <li></li>
