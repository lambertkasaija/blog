    <h3>Software week-1</h3>
    <p>Soft ware engineering  started out all nice with introduction to how the internet works, I was skating through, grasped all the terms and all <br>because most of the videos I had watched them years ago out of curiosity, then came day three, day three jolted me out of dream land as we started VsCode, I realised following closely what Samson was doing and also doing the same on my pc was going to be an uphill task, so I resorted to following closely and trying out that out later on my pace the fourth day had me at par, every thing was running as instructed, the week was good.</p>
